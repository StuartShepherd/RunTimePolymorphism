# Run Time Polymorphism Example
Polymorphism provides an ability for the classes to implement different methods that are called through the same name and it also provides an ability to invoke the methods of a derived class through base class reference during runtime based on our requirements.

Run Time Polymorphism means overriding a base class method in the derived class by creating a similar function and this can be achieved by using override & virtual keywords along with inheritance principle.
